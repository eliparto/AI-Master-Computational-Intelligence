# AI Master Computational Intelligence
AI Master Project: Comparing learning with inherited knowledge to learning from zero in evolutionary robots.

In this project, we investigate whether evolutionary robots converge to better solutions when learning with some brain optimizer with and without inhertied knowledge from the previous generation.

# Installation/prerequisites
- Install Revolve2 at ```https://github.com/ci-group/revolve2/releases```
- Create virtual environment for Revolve2 (see Revolve2 documentation for instructions and usable Python versions).
- Run relevant ```main.py``` file in the script with or without inherited knowledge.
